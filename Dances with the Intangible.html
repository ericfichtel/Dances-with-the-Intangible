i can only feel connected to my past selves<br>
in the lonely corners of the night<br>
they hide in each shadow and lurk around each corner<br>
i do not realize they are what i needed most<br>
until they return for me<br>
the past slowly drips into my present<br>
memories of dimly lit fields<br>
and lustful summer nights<br>
ooze into my horizon<br>

<b>Meanings have an existence independent of people</b><br>

<p>stare overflowing with emptiness <br>
sufferings outgrown by their former owners <br>
quiet man’s face wet from tears <br><br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/images/TyZ1FX">* * *</a>

<p>toy chest covered in dust <br>
mother’s scorn in the shadow of god <br>
field littered with crumbling tombstones <br><br>

<p>smell of death in every room of a childhood home <br>
living rooms decorated like mausoleums<br>

three dots still on the screen <br><br>

<p>insecure in a lover’s arms <br>
words of love from a loveless machine <br>
passionless discussion after a breakup <br><br>

<p>a playground surrounded in caution tape <br>

words of affection forever unexchanged <br><br>

<div id="drowning" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
  <p>i’m in an indoor pool. i work here, it’s a summer job. everyday i climb up the ladder of the high dive and everyday the same wave of fear flows through my body before i jump off and wonder why it is i always do this. only this time after i jump my body cannot move. i feel like i am drugged. my body slams into the water and i slowly sink to the bottom full of terror and unable to move. the surface of the water moves farther and farther away from me as i slowly sink down into the dark abyss that has no visible end.</p>
</div>

<div id="neophyte1" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
<p>the neophyte<br>
awoke at dawn<br>
He wandered through the hills<br>
illuminated by the shadows<br>
of those who came before him<br>
He came across a field<br>
stricken with angst and excitement<br>
Which contained several tribes<br>
he could only distinguish each onev
by the cloaks they wore</p>
</div>

<div id="neophyte2" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
<p>The tribes fought each other<br>
Over the uncloaked individuals in the middle of the field<br>
Hunched over, writhing in paranoia and confusion<br>
Blind to the chaos around them<br>
the neophyte pulled one member of a tribe aside<br>
and asked “Which tribe here is the superior”<br>
The tribe member did not respond at first<br>
But instead produced a magic 8 ball from their cloak<br>
Shook it, and read the answer<br></p>
</div>

<div id="deer" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
<p>the elegance of the deer that I have chased for what feels like forever there is no time in the woods their musk and foot prints and yellow snow is enough to track them I don’t expect to catch them it's the circular nature of the act that makes it beautiful I want to take the pain from their eyes and take that pain and bury it deep inside of me we reach a clearing and we are no more than twenty feet apart I am in awe of their willingness to surrender to curiosity and to begin the process of unlearning that life is nothing more than surviving the winter as they stand there they exhale all the pain and the dread they have accumulated over the years and<br>
I take one step closer to them and they disappear into the woods<br>
I will not chase them for I know they will come back</p>
</div>

<div id="trees" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
  <p>as I meander through the woods the mist begins to settle in and the trees whisper to each other horrible things they will do to me I pull out my phone to call for help but the keys begin to dance and shake and fly off the phone and as the trees sigh deeply I can start to feel the forces acting upon me pushing and pulling
  me in seperate directions and I am suddenly overtaken with fatigue of the gravity of it all I just want it all to end the horror the horror...</p> 
</div>

<div id="thinking" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
  <p>I NEED TO WRITE THIS DOWN, I CANNOT FORGET THIS THOUGHT<br><br>
  but not everything needs to be said</p>
</div>

<div id="trunk" class="tabcontent" style='visibility: hidden'>
<p>I see the reflection of the passing headlights dissolve into the fear in her eyes no I won’t leave her for now she flings herself into the backseat she screams and her demons escape from her mouth the air in the car becomes dense with hate and suffering and insecurities so I roll down a window to let in some of the ocean air a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a smashed bumper and a drunk girl flailing in the trunk barreling down the highway next to the beauty and serenity of the North Shore in the long mystic summer night the world has been too cruel to her too cruel and she won’t come back from the trunk now she’s somewhere else she’s…<br>
She still haunts me through the scent of her perfume on passing strangers
